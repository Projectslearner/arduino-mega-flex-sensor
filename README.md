# Flex Sensor

#### Project Overview

The Flex Sensor project involves using an Arduino Mega to interface with a flex sensor. A flex sensor changes its resistance based on the amount of bend applied to it. This project demonstrates how to connect the flex sensor to the Arduino Mega, read its analog output, and display the sensor values on the Serial Monitor of Arduino IDE. It provides insights into monitoring and interpreting the flex sensor's response to bending movements.

#### Components Needed

1. **Arduino Mega**
2. **Flex Sensor**
3. **Jumper Wires**

#### Block Diagram


#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect the Flex Sensor to Arduino Mega:**
   - **Signal (Analog Output)** to **Analog Pin A0**
   - **VCC** to **5V**
   - **GND** to **GND**

#### Instructions

1. **Install Required Libraries:**
   - No additional libraries are required for this project.

2. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Connect the flex sensor module to the Arduino Mega as specified in the circuit setup section.

3. **Code Upload:**
   - Open Arduino IDE and create a new sketch.
   - Copy and paste the provided Arduino code into the sketch.

4. **Testing:**
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Mega.
   - Open the serial monitor in Arduino IDE to view the flex sensor readings.

#### Applications

- **Gesture Recognition:** Detect hand gestures or finger movements.
- **Prosthetics:** Monitor muscle movement for controlling prosthetic limbs.
- **Gaming:** Implement motion-based controls in gaming devices.
- **Healthcare:** Monitor joint movements or muscle contractions in medical applications.

#### Notes

- Ensure the flex sensor is properly mounted and calibrated for accurate readings.
- Experiment with different bending angles to understand sensor response variations.
- Adjust the delay time in the `loop()` function to control the rate of data updates based on application requirements.
